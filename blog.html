      <h3 class="w3-center">Startup Summer</h3>
  <h6 class="w3-center">June 20, 2018</h6>
  <p>Many people often ask me, "why do you always have to be productive?" Well, I have thought to myself why I keep myself busy all the time. The answer to the question is simply "because I want to." To me, being productive keeps my brain running and consistently thinking of new ideas. As a college student, I believe that it is the prime time to figure out what you want to do. Finding opportunities to advance your skills and figuring out what you want to do is an important component to your college years. Furthermore, it is a privilege to have the opportunity to explore around, I mean afterall you do have three whole months to do whatever you want to do! :)</p>
    <p>Therefore, this summer I decided to take on the position of a Software Design Engineer at Edifecs to work at a startup, Medzii, a personalized treatment plan by combining collective intelligence of humans with machine learning. I thought it would be an amazing opportunity to try out what it is like working in a startup environment. This summer, I specifically wanted to focus on enhancing my networking skills which I acquired from taking Cisco Networking Academy course. I hope to apply my networking skills to the real world and I believe practicing this skill through working on the startup's app would highly benefit me in reaching my goal.</p>
    <p>Today is my third day interning at the company and I absolutely love the welcoming atmosphere.</p>
    <p>For the rest of this week I am planning to finish up my mini task on using Scrapy (web crawler spiders) to grab data from a site for the ingredients of medical treatments within the Medzii App. </p>
