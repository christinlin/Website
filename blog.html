                    <p>It was great to catch up with friends & meet new people to learn about their plans this summer and tech involvement in the local area. The <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/220807088426160/" id="ncwit-site" target="_">Seattle NCWIT community</a> is always very friendly & inclusive of everyone and 
                      I really appreciate them for hosting us for two years in a row now! I am very thankful to be a part of this community as an awardee last year!
