  <h3 class="w3-center">Startup Summer</h3>
  <h6 class="w3-center">June 22, 2018</h6>
    <p>Many people often ask me, "why do you always have to be productive?" Well, I have thought to myself why I keep myself busy all the time. The answer to the question is simply "because I want to." To me, being productive keeps my brain running and consistently thinking of new ideas. As a college student, I believe that it is the prime time to figure out what you want to do. Finding opportunities to advance your skills and figuring out what you want to do is an important component to your college years. Furthermore, it is a privilege to have the opportunity to explore around, I mean afterall you do have three whole months to do whatever you want to do! :)
    </p>
    <p>Therefore, this summer I decided to take on the position of a Software Design Engineer at Edifecs to work at a startup, Medzii, a personalized treatment plan by combining collective intelligence of humans with machine learning. I thought it would be an amazing opportunity to try out what it is like working in a startup environment. This summer, I specifically wanted to focus on enhancing my networking skills which I acquired from taking Cisco Networking Academy course and earning my CCNA. I hope to apply my networking skills to the real world and I believe practicing this skill through working on the startup's app would highly benefit me in reaching this goal.
    </p>
    <p>Additionally, I am currently learning the concept of Machine Learning and will also be working with that over the summer for the Medzii App. My first week interning at at Edifecs has been absolutely one of the most productive and educational weeks of my summer. This week I finished up my mini task on using Scrapy (web crawler spiders) to grab data from a site for the ingredients of medical treatments within the Medzii App. I am really looking forward to the development of this startup because I believe it has great potential and I am grateful to be a part of that growth this summer!

      <h3 class="w3-center">Reflection on First Year of College</h3>
  <h6 class="w3-center">September 27, 2017 - June 7, 2018</h6>
  <p>Coming into college with the mindset of being an engineer, I was ready for the challenge. The road to becoming an engineer isn't an easy task. As a student in the Washington State Academic Redshirt (STARS) Engineering Program, I was prepared for the obstacles I'd encounter in my math & science classes throughout the school year. As the quarters swift by, not only did I progress in my academics, but at the same time I learned about the way I learned in my classes and how to manage my time. </p>
  <p>Furthermore, the STARS Program provided me with a supportive community of friends I had the opportunity to study and share memories with. From the crazy nights of finishing up math study packets to impromptu adventures throughout Seattle, my STARS peers have always been there with me. I am excited for the fall quarter to come so I can learn more from the STARS Program and continue my academic path to becoming an engineer.</p>
