                  <p>February 19, 2017</p>
  <p>During Code Day Eastside at T-Mobile HQ, my team and I created a website targetted towards people with disabilities and inability to express what they feel. We won the "Special Award" for our project's creativity and design. </p>

    <p>The tool we developed allowed users to be able to type in their feelings and current mood into the textbox. We used the Microsoft Cognitive Services API to detect the user's mood from a scale of 0.0 (super sad)-1.0 (super happy). From this data, we were able to decipher what song (in separate array lists based off mood scale) to play in order to soothe their feelings and engage in mindfulness practice.</p>
