  <p>As a college student, my goal is to explore various technologies and programming languages in order to advance my knowledge in computing, opening career and internship opportunities to accelerate my tech career. Furthermore, I am starting my own personal projects this summer and will be posting about my progress on them through my blog. 
  <p>
    After attending Microsoft DigiGirlz High Tech Camp one summer, I challenged myself to enroll in the AP Computer Science class offered at my high school.
