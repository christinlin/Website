  <p class="w3-center">August 16, 2017</p>
  <p>As an intern at Expedia Inc., I was placed on the Local Expert Partner Central Team (LXPC) and worked on the Media Vault Functionality of the Local Expert site. 
    <p>The Expedia Local Expert Team is in charge of the "places to go" when customers select their desired travel destination. It guides customers to the main attractions in their location through organizing activities on the Local Expert site. I worked on both the front end and back end of developing the Media Vault Functionality. This tool helped Local Expert employees to improve efficiency of approving and rejecting photos (based off asset, type, and activity IDs) from suppliers such as Disney and Universal Studios who want their photos for advertisng purposes on Expedia activities.</p>
    <p>During the Expedia Intern Showcase, I had the opportunity to present my Media Vault Functionality project to Expedia employees and interns. </p>

  <p class="w3-center">August 13, 2017</p>
  <p>I competed in the Tune Inc. WE HACK 2017! all-women hackathon and took home the first place trophy for my team's project of Brag Log Mobile SMS Messaging System. 
    <p>The theme of the hackathon was "Women Empowerment," therefore my team and I decided to create an SMS messaging system that records your daily logs of the little and big things individuals like us achieve every single day. Many people tend to have imposter syndrome in their workplace and school work but Brag Log helps to keep you off that mindset. Brag Log helps individuals to be reminded of the great things they do, to-do lists, and self-care with weekly reports texted to their phones.</p>

  <p class="w3-center">February 19, 2017</p>
  <p>During Code Day Eastside at T-Mobile HQ, my team and I created a website targetted towards people with disabilities and inability to express what they feel. We won the "Special Award" for our project's creativity and design. </p>

    <p>The tool we developed allowed users to be able to type in their feelings and current mood into the textbox. We used the Microsoft Cognitive Services API to detect the user's mood from a scale of 0.0 (super sad)-1.0 (super happy). From this data, we were able to decipher what song (in separate array lists based off mood scale) to play in order to soothe their feelings and engage in mindfulness practice.</p>

  <p class="w3-center">August 10, 2016</p>
  <p>In the summer I participated in the Girls Who Code Summer Immersion Program at Expedia Inc., I learned from the teachers assistants and mentors the basics of programming lanuages including Java, Javascript, Python, and also using an Arduino Kit. </p>
  <p>In the final week of the summer program, my team and I used the Twitter API and an Arduino Kit to develop a plant to tweet on Twitter based off a temperature and humidity sensor which connected to the Arduino Kit.
