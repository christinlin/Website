                            <p>Hello! My name is Christin and I am an undergraduate sophomore attending the University of Washington Seattle in the <a href="https://www.engr.washington.edu/stars" id="stars-link" target="_">Washington State Academic Redshirt (STARS) Engineering Program</a> studying computer science & engineering.
                            </p>
                            <p>As a college student, my goal is to explore various technologies and programming languages in order to advance my knowledge in computing & open career and internship opportunities to accelerate my tech career. 
                            </p>
                            <p>I became motivated and passionate to study engineering after attending Microsoft DigiGirlz High Tech Camp in the summer of my sophomore year in high school. In addition, I challenged myself to enroll in the AP Computer Science class offered at my high school. Ever since, I've participated and competed in a diverse range of hackathons throughout the Seattle-Bellevue area to bring my own ideas out to the table. 
                            </p>
                            <p>Additionally, in the summer of my senior year in high school, I interned at <a href="https://www.expediagroup.com/brands/expedia-local-expert/" id="expedia-link" target="_">Expedia Group</a> HQ in Bellevue as a Software Developer Apprentice on the Local Expert Partner Central (LXPC) team working on the Media Vault Functionality project. Last summer I interned at Edifecs, a leading healthcare technology company in Bellevue, to gain insight on the concept of Machine Learning & its technologies on the app, <a href="https://www.medzii.com/" id="medzii-link" target="_">Medzii</a>. Furthermore, I am currently working at T-Mobile HQ in Bellevue participating in the TechX Internship Program on the <a href="https://www.t-mobile.com/offers/t-mobile-tuesdays" id="tmob-link" target="_">T-Mobile Tuesdays</a> Android Development Team. Come check out my <a href="https://medium.com/series/8179c0a8fbc4" id="tmob-link" target="_">T-Mobile TechX Experience</a> on my Medium!   
                            </p>
                            <p>Furthermore, I've been actively searching for opportunities & resources which can help me learn about new technologies & hardware. Living on the Univeristy of Washington Campus, I have had the chance to explore the resources provided at the Area 01 Labs in Maple Hall. I am determined to use the space to create and develop personal projects for myself & class projects this year. I'll be keeping a log of my progress with both learning & using the resouces on my <a href="https://medium.com/series/area-01-dabble-sound-lab-projects-d1d028c602d7" id="area-link" target="_">Area 01 Lab Projects</a> series & you can feel free to read about them on my Medium!</p>
                            <p>This summer, I'll be joining <a href="https://www.cisco.com/" id="expedia-link" target="_">Cisco</a>, the worldwide leader in IT, networking, and cybersecurity solutions company at their Headquarters in San Jose, California as a Software Engineer Intern on their IoT Team! Look out for more updates about my journey as a Cisconian on my <a href="https://medium.com/series/16c960343d4" id="expedia-link" target="_">Summer Intern Adventures</a> series on my Medium!</p>
