<p>Hello! My name is Christin and I am an undergraduate junior attending the University of Washington Seattle in the <a href="https://www.engr.washington.edu/stars" id="stars-link" target="_">Washington State Academic Redshirt (STARS) Engineering Program</a> studying electrical & computer engineering.
                            </p>
                            <p>As a college student, my goal is to explore various technologies and programming languages in order to advance my knowledge in computing & open career and internship opportunities to accelerate my tech career. I am especially interested in the field of IoT, Machine Learning/Artificial Intelligence, and Computer Networking to develop products which can benefit individuals in terms of healthcare, security, and smart home devices.
                            </p>
                            <p>I became motivated and passionate to study engineering after attending <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/diversity/programs/digigirlz/hightechcamp.aspx" id="stars-link" target="_">Microsoft DigiGirlz High Tech Camp<a> in the summer of my sophomore year in high school. In addition, I challenged myself to enroll in the AP Computer Science class offered at my high school. Ever since, I've participated and competed in a diverse range of hackathons throughout the Seattle-Bellevue area to bring my own ideas out to the table. Through participating in a wide range of workshops such as <a href="https://www.codenow.org/" id="resume-link" target"_" CodeNow Seattle<a> & the <a href="https://girlswhocode.com/summer-immersion-programs/" id="resume-link" target"_" Girls Who Code Summer Immersion Program<a>, I was able to develop a community which helped me to further learn about coding technologies and pursue my interest in computing.

<p>
In an effort to spread the awareness of STEM in my local community, in high school, I've launched my own club,  <a href="https://newportstemleague.weebly.com/" id="resume-link" target="_">STEM League<a>, with the motto to "Educate, Inspire, Pursue" and spread the awareness of STEM in my local community through partnering with local libaries to design & host STEM outreach events for students grades K-8. These events are targetted to "Educate" the students about the STEM fields through interactive workshops and through these workshops ultimately "Inspire" them to "Pursue" STEM as a future career. I believe exposure to the STEM fields are an excellent way to help students define their career goals and build a strong foundation for their intended STEM careers. 
                            </p>
                            <p>In college, I've participated in technical internships such as my experience two summers ago, interning with Edifecs, a leading healthcare technology company in Bellevue, to gain insight on the concept of Machine Learning & its technologies on the app, <a href="https://www.medzii.com/" id="medzii-link" target="_">Medzii</a>. Through my internship experience, I was able to takeaway with me the environment of working in a start-up and knowledge of technologies utilized in data mining. This past summer, I joined <a href="https://www.cisco.com/" id="resume-link" target="_">Cisco</a>, the worldwide leader in IT, networking, and cybersecurity solutions company at their Headquarters in San Jose, California as a Software Engineer Intern on the IoT Team! During my time as an intern at Cisco, I worked in a team setting with three other interns on enabling <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/2016/08/22/difference-deep-learning-training-inference-ai/" id="resume-link" target="_"> running inference & deep learning</a> on Cisco Hardware Edge Devices such as the IR8x9 router series to detect anomalies. Feel free to look out for more updates about my journey as a Cisconian (series to be completed) on my <a href="https://medium.com/series/16c960343d4" id="resume-link" target="_">Summer Intern Adventures</a> series on my Medium!</p>
