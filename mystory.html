                    <h1>August 2015 - Microsoft DigiGirlz High Tech Camp & AP Computer Science</h1>
                    <p>I was first exposed to the world of computer science in the summer of my sophomore year in high school when I participated in the <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/diversity/programs/digigirlz/default.aspx" id="digigirlz-site" target="_">Microsoft DigGirlz High Tech Camp</a>.</p>
                    <p>Through the motivational tech talks given from Microsoft employees & speakers, I was inspired to take the AP Computer Science class at my high school. Computer science was no easy subject for me and coming in to the class as a beginner, I was intimidated by the dominating group of male students. Taking on the challenge of going into a field where I 
                      had no previous experience with, I learned to practice coding on my own & go in during tutorial hours at school to reach out for help. </p>
                      <p>Furthermore, I learned to be inattentive to the discouragement I received along the way & use criticism as fuel to do even better. 
                      Through the long nights of practice, I adapted to coding concepts and gradually gained more self confidence in my own work. </p>
                      <p>Thankfully to the wise words from the Microsoft Digi Girlz Camp always in the back of my mind, I not only accomplished the goals I set out for myself, but also developed new skills & the hobby of coding. Microsoft DigiGirlz Camp was definitely a phenomenal experience to help me discover the foundational steps to pursuing a career in tech.
